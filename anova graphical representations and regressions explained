#Notes on visual representations of ANOVA anD ANCOVA and Drug Dealers explaining ANOVA and ANCOVA Regression models.

# Graphical representations
ANOVA (and linear regression) NEVER produces a cube, sphere, or curved surface.
Even with interactions, the model is still linear in the parameters.

What geometry does ANOVA actually produce?
1️⃣ 1-way ANOVA
Geometry: Horizontal lines
One horizontal line per group (each line is the group mean).
Together: a step function is not a smooth line like in linear regression because we have categorical predictors(on-off)

2️⃣ 2-way ANOVA (no interaction)
Geometry: One single flat plane

3️⃣ 2-way ANOVA with interaction
Geometry: One single tilted plane

# Regressions explanations

# ANOVA as Regression (No College Mambo-Jambo)

This document explains **why Minitab prints a regression equation for ANOVA**, using two concrete examples:

1. **1-way ANOVA** – drug dealers and time spent selling on the streets
2. **2-way ANOVA** – time of day × store, predicting junkie footfall

   * first **without interaction**
   * then **with interaction**

The key idea throughout:

> **ANOVA is just linear regression with on/off switches (dummy variables).**

---

## Example 1: 1-Way ANOVA (Drug Dealers)

**Response variable:**

* Time spent on the streets selling

**Factor:**

* Dealer (3 levels): A, B, C

---

### Step 1: Choose a reference group

Minitab automatically picks one level as the baseline.

* **Dealer A = reference**

---

### Step 2: Create dummy variables (switches)

| Dealer | Dealer B | Dealer C |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| A      | 0        | 0        |
| B      | 1        | 0        |
| C      | 0        | 1        |

Dealer A has no switch — that’s the baseline.

---

### Step 3: Regression equation

[
\text{Time} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{Dealer B}) + \beta_2(\text{Dealer C})
]

---

### Step 4: What the coefficients mean

* **β₀** = mean time for Dealer A
* **β₁** = Dealer B mean − Dealer A mean
* **β₂** = Dealer C mean − Dealer A mean

---

### Step 5: Predictions

* Dealer A:
  [ \hat{y} = \beta_0 ]

* Dealer B:
  [ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 ]

* Dealer C:
  [ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 ]

**Result:** each dealer’s fitted value equals its group mean.

---

## Example 2: 2-Way ANOVA (No Interaction)

**Response variable:**

* Number of junkies (footfall)

**Factors:**

* Time of day: Morning, Afternoon, Evening
* Store: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

---

### Step 1: Choose reference levels

* **Morning** (time reference)
* **Store 1** (store reference)

These define the baseline condition.

---

### Step 2: Dummy variables

#### Time of day (3 levels → 2 dummies)

* Afternoon
* Evening

#### Store (5 levels → 4 dummies)

* Store 2
* Store 3
* Store 4
* Store 5

---

### Step 3: Regression equation (additive model)

[
\text{Footfall} =
\beta_0

* \beta_1(\text{Afternoon})
* \beta_2(\text{Evening})
* \beta_3(\text{Store 2})
* \beta_4(\text{Store 3})
* \beta_5(\text{Store 4})
* \beta_6(\text{Store 5})
  ]

---

### Step 4: Meaning of coefficients

* **β₀**
  Mean footfall at **Morning, Store 1**

* **β₁, β₂**
  Effect of time of day (same for all stores)

* **β₃ – β₆**
  Difference between Store 1 and Stores 2–5

---

### Step 5: Prediction example

**Evening at Store 3**

Switches ON:

* Evening = 1
* Store 3 = 1

[
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_4
]

---

## Example 3: 2-Way ANOVA **With Interaction**

Now we allow **time effects to differ by store**.

---

### Step 1: Same main-effect dummies

* Afternoon, Evening
* Store 2, Store 3, Store 4, Store 5

---

### Step 2: Add interaction dummies

Interactions are **products of switches**:

* Afternoon × Store 2
* Afternoon × Store 3
* …
* Evening × Store 5

(Each says: “this specific combo gets its own adjustment.”)

---

### Step 3: Regression equation (with interaction)

[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Footfall} =
&\beta_0

* \beta_1(\text{Afternoon})
* \beta_2(\text{Evening})\
  &+ \beta_3(\text{Store 2})
* \beta_4(\text{Store 3})
* \beta_5(\text{Store 4})
* \beta_6(\text{Store 5})\
  &+ \beta_7(\text{Afternoon} \times \text{Store 2})
* \cdots
* \beta_{14}(\text{Evening} \times \text{Store 5})
  \end{aligned}
  ]

---

### Step 4: What interaction coefficients do

They allow:

* Morning → Afternoon changes to be **different per store**
* Morning → Evening changes to be **different per store**

In plots: lines are **not parallel**.

In geometry: the plane is **tilted**, but still flat.

---

### Step 5: Prediction example

**Evening at Store 3**

Switches ON:

* Evening
* Store 3
* Evening × Store 3

[
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_4 + \beta_{(Evening\times Store3)}
]

---

## Final takeaway (single brain cell approved)

* ANOVA works by **turning categories into switches**
* Minitab fits a **linear regression** using those switches
* Group means = intercept + switches
* Interaction = **extra switches for combinations**
* No curves unless you explicitly add nonlinear terms

> **ANOVA tables test the switches. Regression equations show how the switches add up.**
